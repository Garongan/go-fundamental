### integer data type
- int8 and uint8 -> unsigned int, start from 0
- int16 and uint16
- int32 and uint32
- int64 and uint64
### float data type
- float32
- float64
- complex64
- complex128
### alias for data type
- byte -> uint8
- rune -> int32
- int Minimal int32
- uint -> Minimal uint32
### boolean data type
- true or false
### string data type
- declaration -> `string, "string"`
### function for string
- len("string") -> character length in string
- "string"[number] -> get character by index, and return byte of strings
### variable
- variable is to storing data
- how to write variable -> `var name`
- multiple declaration variable -> `var (name = "yourName", age = 24)`
### constant
- is variable constant, can't to re assign
- create constant must assign the value
### data type conversion
- example want to conversion from int32 -> int64
### type declaration
- the ability to create new object with same type
- the purpose is to understanding object by create alias
